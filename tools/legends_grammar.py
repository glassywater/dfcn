"""Compile reviewed Legends event families, not save-specific sentences.

Input: source<TAB>target<TAB>mode. `action` supplies a predicate and compiles
named/unnamed/entity participants, omitted subjects and coordinated actions.
`event` supplies a complete clause. Both support native location/time suffixes.
`clause` is a literal/template used as-is; `term` is a scoped semantic term.
`reputation` also exposes that complete label to adventurer People cards,
including scrolled labels whose Reputation heading is no longer visible.
`statement` is a complete clause with its own subject, also emitted in native
sentence-initial/lowercase and "and ..." forms. Chinese separates the latter
with a comma, not the noun-list connector or a shared-subject action prefix.
`title` is a reviewed event summary, also usable inside another event's {e}.
`interaction-action` is a reviewed procedural IS_HIST_STRING pair. It supplies
the ordinary action and its native "the moment when ..." event summary from
the same predicate, retaining both participants and the complete interaction.
`age` is a named historical era term with its complete native heading.
BOOK_INSTRUCTION's `[NAME] In [ANY_AGE]` uses the shared runtime era grammar,
including generated titles and recurring ordinals, without per-era templates.
`description` is a recursive physical-description noun phrase, not prose.
`identity` is a quoted or unnamed historical identity; it never enters the
prose or participant grammars and preserves a complete person's link.
`creature-status` is a description prefix shared with typed species/castes.
Its source and target each end in one {s}; vocabulary generation reuses it.
`continuation` is a visible clipped prefix, isolated from complete prose in hC.
`office` and `office-prefix` supply the finite generated office vocabulary.
Their combinations compile into complete scoped terms, never global words.
`civic-domain` and `civic-office` supply the separate municipal duty/title
family. Its components are not standalone terms or court-rank combinations.
`religious-prefix` combines a priest-rank prefix with the installed RAW
noun forms and their shared WORD-aware senses, not the court/civic roles.
Homonymous nouns may reuse the existing procedural-name default when it is
one of their shared noun senses. Only complete titles become scoped terms.
`behavior` supplies a generated creature sentence, including its native
coordination with an optional "It has ..." appendage description.
`experiment-origin` and `failed-experiment-origin` frame the native night
creature origin. Their {s} is a compile-time method slot, replaced by one
reviewed `experiment-method`, `failed-experiment-method` or shared
`experiment-power`. The method's {a} slot receives an optional reviewed
`experiment-subject`; all resulting person/species/place captures stay typed.
`response` is an action that can carry a reviewed `concession`. These two
finite catalogues compile whole "..., despite ..." clauses in Chinese order;
the reason is not an unrestricted prose/name capture.
`mortality-action` and `mortality-reason` compile the reviewed mortality
predicate and its single terminal motivation with the cause before the action.
Their ordinary action/clause forms remain available for other native contexts.
`{q}` is a color capture resolved only through the shared color vocabulary.
All emitted entries stay in the h namespace and retain numbered link captures.

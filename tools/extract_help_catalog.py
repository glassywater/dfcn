"""Inventory native help, tutorial objectives, and adventure guidance from PE.

This reads the installed executable without loading or running it. Native help
constructors, draw calls, and all their branch-local literal references are
inventoried together. Key and paragraph markup is decoded at construction
boundaries. Dynamic branches retain their constituent provenance.

The catalog contains English sources only.  Translations remain in
data/runtime/help-translations.tsv, and the build checks that every catalog entry is covered.
